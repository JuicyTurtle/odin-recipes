        Description(acording to wikipedia):
    </h2>
    <h4>
        In Ancient Rome there was a dish similar to a traditional lasagne called lasana or lasanum (Latin for 'container' or 'pot') described in the book De re coquinaria by Marcus Gavius Apicius,[13] but the word could have a more ancient origin. The first theory is that lasagne comes from Greek λάγανον (laganon), a flat sheet of pasta dough cut into strips.[14][15][16][17] The word λαγάνα (lagana) is still used in Greek to mean a flat thin type of unleavened bread baked for the holiday Clean Monday.

        Another proposed link or reference is the 14th-century English dish loseyn[22] as described in The Forme of Cury, a cookbook prepared by "the chief Master Cooks of King Richard II",[23] which included English recipes as well as dishes influenced by Spanish, French, Italian, and Arab cuisines.[24] This dish has similarities to modern lasagne in both its recipe, which features a layering of ingredients between pasta sheets, and its name. An important difference is the lack of tomatoes, which did not arrive in Europe until after Columbus reached the Americas in 1492. The earliest discussion of the tomato in European literature appeared in a herbal written in 1544 by Pietro Andrea Mattioli,[25] while the earliest cookbook found with tomato recipes was published in Naples in 1692, but the author had apparently obtained these recipes from Spanish sources
